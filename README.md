# ESP8266-DS18B20-Thingspeak
ESP8266 with DS18B20 temp sensor reporting to Thingspeak and driving local LEDs
Using ESP8266-based hardware to monitor temperatures via DS18B20 and then report temp every 60 seconds to ThingSpeak.com whilst driving
local LEDs to indicate if temperature is within set bounds.

Working:  Reading multilpe sensors and sending data to Thingspeak.  Tested on WeMos mini and Amcia NodeMCU. 

TODO: Add code for LEDS.
